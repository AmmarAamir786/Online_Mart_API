#Create Engine
    # Engine is used to establish the connection between our app and our db (neon)
    # Engine is one for whole application
    # Psycopg translates Python code and data structures into commands and data formats that PostgreSQL understands, enabling seamless interaction between your application and the database.

#Create Session
    # for every fuction/transaction there will be a new session
    # E.g for every new logged in user, a new session is made
    # when user logs out, session closes
    # we are creating our session in a generator function so it closes the session automatically whenever we dont need it
